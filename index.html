    <p>My name is Henry Kirse and I currently live in Durham, NC.  I moved here with my wife 4 years ago from Portland, OR.  
        We love to go on hikes all around the state from the Eno River in Durham to the mountains of Asheville.
        Our dog, Millie, has been with us on many of these hiking adventures and loves the outdoors just as much as we do.</p>

    <p>When we are not out exploring the state, I love my time here in Durham and checking out a brewery or a new place to eat.  
        During the baseball season, it is always fun to check out a Bulls game as well.  Durham is growing up fast and I am very
        happy to be part of it.
